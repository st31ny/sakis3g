Description: Tool for establishing 3G connections
 Sakis3G is a tweaked shell script which is supposed to work 
 out-of-the-box for establishing a 3G connection with any 
 combination of modem or operator. It automagically setups 
 your USB or Bluetoothâ„¢ modem, and may even detect operator 
 settings. You should try it when anything else fails.
